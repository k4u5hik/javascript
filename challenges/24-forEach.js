// forEach is a method that takes a callback function as an argument.
// The callback function is called for each element in the array.
// The callback function is called with three arguments:
// 1. The current element being processed in the array.
// 2. The index of the current element being processed in the array.
// 3. The array itself.
// The callback function must return a value.
// The return value is ignored.
// The forEach method returns undefined.
// The following code logs the numbers 1 through 5 to the console.
// The forEach method is called on the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
