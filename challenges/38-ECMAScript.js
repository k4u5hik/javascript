// Define, Update and Redefine:
// - You can define, update and redefine VAR
// - You can define and update LET but cannot redefine it
// - You can define CONST but cannot update or redefine it

// Scope:
// - LET & CONST are block scoped - anything within {} - same nesting level only
// - VAR is (so can LET & CONST be) function scoped - can be accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function
